SnailSlider

SnailSlider uses the JQuery library to make a simple slider application that can live on a web page. It is free to use!

The basic setup is as follows:

#Include the stylesheet, JQuery, and snailslider.js in your page header
#Include the SnailSlider code in your page
#Put your images into the code

Each image you put in will be automatically added in the order you include them, they must be wrapped in div tags though.

For an example, included in the package is a html file that is set up to display the slider.
